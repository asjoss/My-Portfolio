# My-Portfolio

This is [My portfolio](https://asjoss.github.io/My-Portfolio/) website to display my front-end web developement skills. 

It contains:
- a Header section (name, profile picture)
- a brief introduction about me
- 4 boxes with images of different projects
- a footer containing a contact form

The basic structure is there but various CSS stylings need to be corrected/added as envisaged in my wireframe.

I also need add in Javascript functionality to make my website fully interactive. This will be a ongoing process as i want to practice refactoring my code, trying out different CSS styling and changing this repo to React.
