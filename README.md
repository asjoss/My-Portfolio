# My-Portfolio

This is [My portfolio](https://asjoss.github.io/My-Portfolio/) website to display my front-end web developement skills. 

It contains:
- a Header section (name, profile picture)
- a brief introduction about me
- 4 boxes with images of different projects
- a footer containing a contact form

The basic structure is there but various CSS styling needs to be corrected/added to match my wireframe (see attached). ![My Portfolio Wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92714530/158209066-9a1078fa-5a0a-461a-8c44-7caef9c6d72c.jpg)

I also need add in Javascript functionality to make my website fully interactive.
